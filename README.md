## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. Database Modeling (MySQL)
- Imported raw data into MySQL.
- Normalized tables to reduce redundancy.
- Defined primary/foreign key relationships for sales facts and dimensions.
- Used SQL for computing aggregated metrics (total revenue, monthly trends, product breakdowns).

### 2. Analytics Using SQL
Performed queries such as:
- Total sales & revenue over time
- Category-wise sales breakdown
- Top products by revenue & volume
- Regional performance
- Order trends by month/quarter

### 3. Visualization (Power BI)
Built interactive dashboards to visualize:
- Revenue trends (yearly, quarterly, monthly)
- Sales distribution by product category
- Geographic / regional sales heat maps
- Top performing products
- KPIs: Total Sales, Average Order Value, Growth %, etc.

## 📊 Key Insights (Examples)

✔ Revenue shows seasonal peaks.  
✔ Certain categories contribute disproportionately to overall sales.  
✔ Regional sales patterns help identify target markets.  
✔ Interactive cards highlight top products and trend lines.
